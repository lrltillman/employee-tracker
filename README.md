# Employee Tracker

## Description
This Employee Tracker is a CLI app that can be used to view, add, or update employee records within a company database. The tracker manages the roles, departments, and employees within a company, along with other valuable information like salaries and supervisors. It is essentially an interface for a company database that allows for records to be modified and tracked. 

## Use
This is a helpful tool for a small but growing company. To use this app, a user will need to run it through node.js on their command line. The app is self-instructional in the sense that it will prompt you with the exact action you need to take. Any time a record is added or updated, a confirmation will show up in the console. After each action, a user has the option to return to the main menu, or exit the app. 

## Tech Stack
This app uses JavaScript, Node.js (including the sequelize, dotenv, and inquirer dependencies) and mySQL. Also used Screencastify to create the demo video. There is no front-end or server for this app.

Here is an example of what the app looks like:
